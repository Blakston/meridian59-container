# Meridian59-Build

Build your own Meridian59 server and client by using the official 2.9 version of server 105 as a foundation.

## Prerequisites

- Clone the Meridian59 server from [here](https://github.com/andygeiss/Meridian59_105_2.9.git) to your local machine into a folder named `meridian59-base`.
- Clone the Meridian59 Ogre client from [here](https://github.com/andygeiss/meridian59-dotnet.git) to your local machine into a folder named `meridian59-dotnet`.
- Checkout the `main` branch on both repositories and compile each project by using VisualStudio 2017 with its required dependencies (can be automatically downloaded).
